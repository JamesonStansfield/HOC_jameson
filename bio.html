            John Vincent Atanasoff. A man born on October 4th, 1903 in Hamilton, New York. Died June 15th, 1995 in
            Frederick, Maryland. John was a well known mathmetician and physicist. He became well known at the time
            when he invented the worlds first digital computer. He went to Iowa state College which is today, a 
            University. In the 1930s, Atanasoff was big in math and would use analogue computers to preform his
            calculations. This is when he discovered the true struggle with using these computers, they were slow.
            The computers were full of limitations that were holding him back. He would often take hours to preform 
            his calculations and this is where he gained a new desire to create a faster and better computer. A 
            computer capable of handling what he required of it to do. He worked alongside with clifford berry 
            who had a masters degree in physics and a bachelors in electrical engineering. They worked together 
            on creating a digital computer and finished the prototype in 1939. From there, they continued their
            hard work to craft a full scale version in 1942. John Atanasoff eventually graduated from Iowa and met 
            the person who he would end up marrying, Lura Meeks. John Atanasoff went on to develop what he is known
            for, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer.
