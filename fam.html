                John Atanasoff worked alongside a graduate student, Clifford Berry. He was born April 19th, 
                1918 and died October 30th, 1963 at just 45 years old. He was another American who also went
                to Iowa state college. Clifford Berry obtained his bachelors in electrical engineering and
                his masters in physics.

            John Atanasoff grew up with his ggrowing interest and passion for engineering and math. At a 
            young age, he would read college math books with his mother and learn concepts as he had a 
            great interest in math. He carried on to enter the Mulberry High School and complete the entire
            school course in just 2 years with straight A's. He knew that he was going to study theoretic 
            physics. As he grew up and went on to the University of Florida, he received his bachelors of 
            science in electrical engineering. After this, many famous universities like Harvard reached out 
            to him although he decided to go on a different path by taking a program more tutored towards 
            his specific interests at Iowa state College. He was a very busy man during this time as he was 
            taking his masters course and teaching two undergraduate programs at the same time. John was 
            very successful in his education and work.
